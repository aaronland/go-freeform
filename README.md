# go-freeform

Tools for working with files created by Apple's FreeForm application.

## Documentation

Documentation is incomplete at this time.

## Motivation

These are tools I wrote for myself, mostly to extract images from the PDF documents produced Apple's FreeForm application. They are not general purpose tools for an audience other than myself and are released "as is" in a spirit of generousity so that they might be of use to people trying to solve similar problems.
